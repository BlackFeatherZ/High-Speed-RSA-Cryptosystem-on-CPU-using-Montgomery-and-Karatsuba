# High-Speed-RSA-Cryptosystem-on-CPU-using-Montgomery-and-Karatsuba-
Goal: Implement a high speed RSA cryptosystem by using software programming 
languages on x86 computers.
Major Functions:
• Support both RSA encryption and decryption (use public key to encrypt and 
secrete key to decrypt).
• Support 4096-bit keysize.
• Support 1024-bit message encryption and decryption.
• A timer in the RSA system to record the encryption and decryption time.
